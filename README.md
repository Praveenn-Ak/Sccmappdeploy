Getting Started:
1. Download and Convert to .exeBegin by downloading the SCCM Application Deployment Tool script. Once you've reviewed and made any necessary changes to the hardcoded configurations inside the script, convert it into an executable (.exe) file. This makes it easy for your deployment team to integrate it into their daily routines.
2. Understanding the ScriptTake the time to understand the script structure. While configurations are hardcoded, we encourage users to explore the script and feel comfortable making adjustments to suit their specific needs. Detailed comments within the script provide guidance on areas that can be customized.
3. Execute and DeployWith the tool converted to an executable, your deployment team can seamlessly integrate it into their workflow. Execute the tool and let it work its magic â€” validating deployments, sending notifications, and introducing that crucial delay to catch potential issues.

Future Considerations:In the spirit of continuous improvement, we're aware that a configuration file could enhance the tool's flexibility. This is something we're actively considering for future versions. We invite your feedback and suggestions to make this tool even more valuable for the SCCM community.

Security First:As with any deployment tool, security is paramount. Ensure that sensitive information, even if hardcoded, is handled with care. Follow best practices to safeguard your deployment processes and maintain the integrity of your SCCM environmen
